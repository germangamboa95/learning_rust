# German's notes on rust 

Hello if you are not German, why are you reading this? 
Anyways this repo is just me following along with the rust book in while getting started in rust.


## Day Uno 

Stopping at chapter two for the night. Things are pretty similar to concepts that I am familiar with. 
I like the error handling with the match used in the guessing game. 
One thing that is confusing me is "is the semicolon needed or not?". Programs seem to run without and the ide is not screaming at me to add it so not sure. 
Happy to be working back with something low level after only writing JS for a while.
